    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, an object could represent a person with properties like a name, age, and address and behaviors such as walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or it could represent an email with properties like a recipient list, subject, and body and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things, like cars, as well as relations between things, like companies and employees, students and teachers, and so on. OOP models real-world entities as software objects that have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Any language that has all the following three features can be considered OO. They are:  \n",
    "- Encapsulation\n",
    "- Inheritance\n",
    "- Polymorphism\n",

    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "So polymorphism is the ability (in programming) to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in many languages, integers and floats are implicitly polymorphic since you can add, subtract, multiply and so on, irrespective of the fact that the types are different. They're rarely considered as objects in the usual term.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic example is the Shape class and all the classes that can inherit from it (square, circle, dodecahedron, irregular polygon, splat and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "With polymorphism, each of these classes will have different underlying data. A point shape needs only two co-ordinates (assuming it's in a two-dimensional space of course). A circle needs a center and radius.\n",
