# Python Notebooks Covering Fundamentals of Various Topics

These notebooks can be used for practice, as reference material or refreshers. I use these notebooks for conducting training sessions for python newbies and also refreshing my own skills.
The following topics are currently covered. More topics will be added in the future and the existing ones will be updated from time to time.

- **Pandas** for Exploratory Data Analysis (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
